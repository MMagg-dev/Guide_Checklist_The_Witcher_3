# Terms of Use

Please read these terms of use before agreeing to them in the mobile application.  
\
Guide, Checklist - Witcher 3 is a mobile application (“app”, “service”) developed by MMagg (“Mahak Aggarwal”, “me”, “my”, “I”, “developer”) made available to you (“user”), free of cost. These terms of use constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the developer. As the user of the application, confirm the acceptance of these application terms of use. If you do not agree to them, then you must uninstall the application and discontinue its use. This document must be read alongside the [privacy policy](https://github.com/MMagg-dev/Guide_Checklist_The_Witcher_3/blob/main/legal/Privacy_Policy.md).
The terms of use are effective as of version 1.0.0 and above of the application.
\
You are not allowed to copy, or modify the application, or the application’s images and logos in any way. You are not allowed to extract the source code of the application, and you are also not allowed to translate the application into other languages or make derivative versions. The application trademarks, copyright, database rights, and intellectual property rights still belong to the developer. The app is a fan-based application based on the The Witcher 3 game developed by CD Projekt. This app is not maintained by, affiliated to or endorsed by CD Projekt Red or CD Projekt.  
\
The developer is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re paying for.
\
The application uses third-party software providers which store and process personal data that you have provided to us, to provide the service. It is your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the application secure. We, therefore, recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the application won’t work properly or at all.  
\
The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.

You should be aware that there are certain things that developer will not take responsibility for. Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but the developer cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and don’t have any of your data allowance left.  
\
If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill payer to use the app.  
\
Along the same lines, the developer cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail the service, the developer cannot accept responsibility.  
\
With respect to the developer’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. The developer accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app. 
\
At some point, the developer may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the requirements for the system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. The developer does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, the developer may also wish to stop providing the app and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless the developer tells you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.  

### Changes to the Terms of Use
The developer may update the terms of use from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. You will be notified of any changes through this page and through the application. These changes will be effective immediately after they have been posted on this page.
