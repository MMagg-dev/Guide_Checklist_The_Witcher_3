### Service Providers
I may employ third-party companies and individuals for the following reasons: 
*	To facilitate this service
*	To provide service on our behalf
*	To perform application-related services, or
*	To assist in analyzing how this service is used

These third parties have access to your personal information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose. 

### Security
Your trust is valued in providing your personal information, and therefore I am striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

### Links to Other Sites
This service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me.

These services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take the necessary actions.

### Changes to Privacy Policy
